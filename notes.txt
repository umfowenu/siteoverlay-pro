Perfect. All working -finally. So what was teh problem getting this dynamic content to display in teh plugin and settings page in the end?
ðŸŽ¯ SUMMARY: What Went Wrong & How We Fixed It

Great question! Here's the complete journey of problems we encountered and solved:
ðŸš¨ THE MAIN PROBLEMS (In Order):
1. WordPress Transient System Failure

    Problem: set_transient() returned TRUE but get_transient() returned nothing
    Cause: Hosting environment restrictions on WordPress transients
    Solution: Switched to WordPress Options (update_option/get_option) as backup

2. WordPress Option Size Limits

    Problem: update_option() returned FALSE for full 14-item API content (944 bytes)
    Cause: Hosting provider blocking large data or specific content
    Solution: Implemented dynamic auto-chunking (split into 5-item chunks)

3. Content-Specific Blocking

    Problem: Even 5-item chunks - Chunk 1 failed while Chunks 0 & 2 worked
    Cause: Specific content in Chunk 1 (items 5-9) blocked by hosting
    Solution: Graceful partial storage - skip failed chunks, store working ones

4. Diagnostic Test Contamination

    Problem: Real API data was cached, but display showed key_0: value_0 dummy data
    Cause: Test 4 in admin diagnostics created dummy data that overwrote real cache
    Solution: Disabled Test 4, added Test 5 to properly cache real API data

5. Key Mapping Mismatch

    Problem: Cache had metabox_boost_title but display logic requested admin_boost_title
    Cause: Inconsistent key names between API storage and display methods
    Solution: Updated display logic to use correct keys from cached data

ðŸ“Š FINAL ARCHITECTURE:

âœ… API â†’ Chunked Storage â†’ Partial Cache â†’ Display Logic

    14 items fetched from API
    Split into 3 chunks (5, 5, 4 items)
    2 chunks stored (Chunk 1 skipped due to hosting restrictions)
    9 items displayed with proper key mapping

Result: Dynamic content working with graceful degradation! ðŸŽ‰
