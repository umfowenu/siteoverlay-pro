# Debug: Marius@shaw.ca Not Arriving in AWeber

## Current Status
- ✅ Railway API: Working (`"pabbly_status":"email_sent"`)
- ✅ Pabbly Webhook: Accepting data (`"Response Accepted"`)
- ❌ AWeber: Not receiving subscriber (marius@shaw.ca)

## Issue Analysis

The webhook is reaching Pabbly successfully, but the AWeber integration is failing silently. This suggests:

1. **AWeber step is configured incorrectly**
2. **AWeber connection has expired**
3. **Email domain filtering** by AWeber
4. **Missing required fields** in AWeber action
5. **Workflow execution errors**

## Immediate Debugging Steps

### 1. Check Pabbly Execution Logs
**In your Pabbly Connect dashboard:**

1. Go to your SiteOverlay Pro workflow
2. Click on **"History"** or **"Execution Logs"**
3. Look for the most recent execution (should show the webhook I just sent)
4. **Check each step** to see where it's failing:
   - ✅ Webhook Trigger (should show received data)
   - ❓ AWeber Action (check for errors here)

### 2. Check AWeber Step Configuration
**In the AWeber action step:**

1. **Verify the connection** - click "Test Connection"
2. **Check required fields:**
   - Email: `{email}` (from webhook)
   - Name: `{customer_name}` (from webhook)
   - List: Make sure it's set to the correct list name
3. **Check for any error messages** in the step

### 3. Test with Minimal Data
**Simplify the AWeber action to just:**
- Email: `{email}`
- Name: `{customer_name}`
- List: Your list name

Remove any optional fields that might be causing issues.

## Likely Issues & Solutions

### Issue A: AWeber Connection Expired
**Solution:** Reconnect AWeber in Pabbly
1. Go to Pabbly integrations
2. Find AWeber connection
3. Click "Reconnect" or "Refresh"
4. Re-authorize with AWeber

### Issue B: List Name Mismatch
**Solution:** Verify exact list name
1. In AWeber: Check your list name exactly
2. In Pabbly: Ensure it matches (case-sensitive)
3. Common issue: Extra spaces or different capitalization

### Issue C: Required Fields Missing
**Solution:** Add all required fields
- Email (required)
- Name (often required)
- Any custom fields your list requires

### Issue D: Email Domain Filtering
**Solution:** Check AWeber's blocked domains
- Shaw.ca might be filtered by AWeber
- Check AWeber's spam/blocked domain list
- Test with a different email domain

## Quick Test

**Try this simplified test:**

1. **Temporarily modify your Pabbly workflow**
2. **Add a "Send Email" action** before the AWeber step
3. **Send yourself the webhook data** to see what Pabbly receives
4. **Check if the data looks correct**

## Alternative Email Test

Let me test with a different Canadian email domain:

```bash
curl -X POST "https://connect.pabbly.com/workflow/sendwebhookdata/IjU3NjYwNTZhMDYzNjA0M2M1MjZjNTUzNjUxMzEi_pc" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "email": "marius.test@gmail.com",
    "license_key": "TRIAL-ALT-TEST-2024",
    "license_type": "trial",
    "customer_name": "Marius Nothling",
    "aweber_list": "siteoverlay-pro",
    "aweber_tags": "trial,siteoverlay-pro,wordpress-plugin"
  }'
```

## Expected Findings

**Check your Pabbly execution logs for:**
1. **Webhook step:** Should show all the data I sent
2. **AWeber step:** Should show either:
   - ✅ Success message
   - ❌ Error message (this is what we need to see)

## Next Steps

1. **Check Pabbly execution logs** immediately
2. **Look for AWeber step errors**
3. **Test AWeber connection**
4. **Verify list name and required fields**
5. **Report back what error you see** in the AWeber step

The issue is definitely in the Pabbly → AWeber connection, not the webhook delivery.
