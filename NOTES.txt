ðŸŽ¯ GIVE THE NEW AI JUST ONE VERSION:

Give them the SECOND version you provided (the longer one with more features) - it had the scrollbar fix AND better functionality.

Tell the new AI exactly this:

"This SiteOverlay Pro plugin works perfectly but has one issue: it shows as ACTIVE and allows all features even when there's no license activated.

The plugin should be DISABLED and show as INACTIVE when no valid license is present. Only trial licenses or paid licenses should enable the plugin features.

Please fix the license enforcement so the plugin is disabled without a valid license, while keeping the fast overlay display and scrollbar fix intact."

That's it. The new AI will have fresh memory and can make this simple fix without getting overwhelmed by our long conversation history.

Don't mention cursorrules or our previous attempts - just focus on the core issue: license enforcement.







ðŸ“‹ FOR THE NEW COORDINATOR - BRIEF THEM ON:

    Main Issue: Plugin allows full functionality without any license (should be disabled)

    What Works:
        Overlay display with scrollbar fix
        API communication with Railway
        Admin interface and trial registration

    What Needs Fixing:
        License enforcement (disable features when no license)
        Plugin should show "INACTIVE" without valid license

    Keep Intact:
        Fast overlay loading (no delays)
        CSS scrollbar fix
        Railway API integration

ðŸŽ¯ TELL NEW COORDINATOR: "Take the working plugin, fix license enforcement to disable features without valid license, but keep fast overlay display and scrollbar fix."

The Railway team will continue working fine - they just need the plugin to properly enforce their license validation responses.
